- In HTML, a **tag** is used to **create an element**.

- The **name of an HTML element** is the name that appears:

  - in the **start tag** → e.g., `<p>`
  - in the **end tag** → e.g., `</p>`

- Example:

  - In `<p>...</p>`, the element name is **p**.
  - In `<div>...</div>`, the element name is **div**.

- In **end tags**, the element name is always **preceded by a slash** (`</p>`).

- Some elements are **void elements**:

  - They **do not have content** inside.
  - Their **end tag is not required or allowed**.
  - Examples: `<br>`, `<img>`, `<hr>`, `<input>`.
